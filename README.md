# MusicPlayerPro

MusicPlayerPro is a JavaFX and CSS-based music player project developed for academic purposes. The program allows users to listen to music from a pre-loaded database of tracks and project resources. It encompasses all essential features of a music player, such as playing selected songs, shuffling, playing the next track, and seeking to a specific second of a song.

## Features
- **Playback Control:** Listen to selected songs, shuffle mode, play the next track, and seek to any second of the song.
- **User Authentication:** Users need to log in, and there are three user types: regular user, premium user, and admin.
- **User Privileges:**
  - *Regular User:* Access to shuffle mode only.
  - *Premium User:* Access to shuffle mode, play selected songs, and play songs sequentially.
  - *Admin:* All privileges of regular and premium users, plus an admin panel for user management (e.g., delete users, change usernames, assign user types).

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository.
2. Compile and run the program using Java and JavaFX.
3. Log in using your credentials.

## What I Learned
